# Valet Fedora Plus

Valet Fedora+ is a development environment for Fedora Linux. No Vagrant, no Docker, no /etc/hosts file.  Since Valet Fedora+ is intended to replace Valet, it still uses the same valet command-line name. Any changes in its interface are documented below.

Valet Fedora Plus is based on valet linux plus, just targetted for Fedora users.
